Don't Make Me Think questions (2)
Website validates using validator.w3.org (2)
Proper HTML structure (6)
Proper use of grid, including matching grid layout from screenshot (2)
CSS to match desired page layout (8)

EXTRA CREDIT - Colored banner at top (2) - Only try this if you complete the rest and still have time remaining.

------------------------
WEBSITE INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------

Use the provided template files and add the necessary HTML and CSS to make the desired layout.
Use the 12-col grid. Shadowed box is 8 columns. News area is 4 columns. The rest should be obvious.

Make sure the image and text underneath it aren't touching the edge of the shadow box.

Make sure the text sizes are relatively the same as in the screenshot. (Example: the date is smaller than the blog post name. Miami Scene is really large and fits across the width of the main page area.)

All text is black except where I note it is a specific color.

DO NOT USE <hr> to create the lines (hint: use the box model).

Submit ONE .ZIP file (with all your website files) to the "Exam" quest on the Queso website
